        Logically its more complicated to compare archived folder structure to
        that of the AddonsDir. StagingDir acts as a temp Addons Dir.
        It gets deleted at the end of the script. It does mean theres an additional
        two steps of 1. Copying Dirs to Addons, 2. Deleting StagingDir

        If Dir exists in both Addons and extracted TempDir123, then copy the Dir
        to Addons to update addon. If the Addon contains a new Dir, prompt the user. 
        However, as long as no unrelated zips were downloaded in the prior 2 hours...
        it should be fine.
