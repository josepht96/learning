CAP Theorem:
the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, 
states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide 
more than two out of the following three guarantees:
	Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
	Availablity: Every request receives a non-error response, without the guarantee that it 
		     contains most recent write
	Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages 
			     being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes
Primarily this is a choice between consistency and availability
