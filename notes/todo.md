## Why SRE, DevOps

Enjoy working across teams
Debugging/problem solving
Responsibility
Essential roles but often overlooked
Find how computers and systems work more interesting than say a JS framework
Get to do a little bit of everything - not pigeon holed

Weak areas:
Monitoring - learning tooling (grafana, prometheus) to monitor k8s, ec2s
incident response - learning how to safely respond to incidents
Learning to support stable systems, replication, running multiple instances of the same application

## Testing

Unit
Integration
System
Smoke/sanity tests
Performance tests
Regression tests
Production tests
Stress tests
Canary tests
