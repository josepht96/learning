# Planning migration to Azure

Five Rs: 
    1. Rehost: Take existing architecture and deploy to Azure. Lift and shift. Least amount of change, least impact but doesnt take advantage of cloud services really
    2. Refactor: Change services to take advantage of cloud services (eg, iis server to web app)
    3. Rearchitecture: Change the code, architecture, infrastructure to utilize cloud services optimally
    4. Rebuild: Maybe just rebuild the entire product (?)
    5. Replace: Replace existing infrastructure with similar Azure services
# Discover
Figure out what resources need to be migrated
1. Download preconfigured virtual machine or appliance to install on active VM
2. 

# Assess
Determine what hardware/infrastructure requirements are for services
# Migrate
Azure Migrate works with On-prem hyper-V and VMware, physical machines, and VMs from other clouds. 
# Optimize
Cloud is easy to adjust, mistakes aren't a huge deal in Azure.
