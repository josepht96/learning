# Terraform – Getting Started
Infrastructure as Code: Provisioning infrastructure through software to achieve consistent and predictable environments. Environment will look how the configuration file says it should. 
Think Azure DevOps yaml pipeline files. 
Declarative vs Imperative: Imperative commands describe what you need and how to get there. Declarative language defines what you want, its components, and itll build it for you. Terraform is a declaration based software. 
Idempotent: Desired state vs actual state idea: If a command is executed and the process is already in effect, it will decline the command. Terraform pushes its commands to target machines. 
Automated deployments, consistent environments, repeatable process, reusable components, documented architecture. 
Scenario: 
Say you want to deploy frontend and backend applications to Azure and you need to provision resources for it…
