Certainly! Establishing a connection to an HTTPS endpoint involves multiple steps, primarily to ensure the security and confidentiality of the communication. I'll provide an overview, focusing on the handshake process, which is central to HTTPS.

### Step-by-step Connection to an HTTPS Endpoint:

1. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Before making a connection, the client (usually a web browser) must resolve the domain of the HTTPS endpoint to an IP address.
   - The client queries a DNS server to obtain the IP address for the domain.

2. **TCP Handshake**:
   - Once the IP address is known, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server using the three-way handshake:
     1. Client sends a SYN packet.
     2. Server responds with a SYN-ACK packet.
     3. Client sends an ACK packet.

3. **ClientHello**:
   - After the TCP connection is established, the client sends a "ClientHello" message to start the SSL/TLS handshake.
   - The "ClientHello" message contains:
     - The highest TLS protocol version the client supports.
     - A randomly generated value (client random).
     - A list of supported cipher suites.
     - Supported compression methods.

4. **ServerHello**:
   - The server replies with a "ServerHello" message that contains:
     - The chosen protocol version (from those offered by the client).
     - A randomly generated value (server random).
     - The chosen cipher suite from the list the client provided.
     - The chosen compression method.

5. **Server Certificate**:
   - The server sends its digital certificate to the client. This certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that the client trusts.
   - The certificate contains the server's public key and other details that validate the server's identity.

6. **Key Exchange**:
   - The client verifies the server's certificate against its list of trusted CAs. If the verification is successful, it continues with the handshake.
   - The client generates a pre-master secret and encrypts it with the server's public key (obtained from the server's certificate).
   - The client sends the encrypted pre-master secret to the server.
   - Both the client and server generate session keys from the pre-master secret.

7. **Finished**:
   - The client sends a "Finished" message, encrypted with the session key.
   - The server will decrypt the message using its session key and send its "Finished" message back to the client.
   - Both parties can now exchange application data over the secured connection.

8. **Data Transfer**:
   - Application data can now be securely transferred over this connection. Both the client and server will use the session keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.

9. **Connection Termination**:
   - Either side can initiate a connection termination. 
   - SSL/TLS has a specific alert message to indicate the closure, ensuring the session ends securely.

The above steps are a simplified overview of the handshake and subsequent data transfer in HTTPS. The handshake ensures both parties can trust each other (authentication), the data can't be intercepted and understood by eavesdroppers (confidentiality), and that the data can't be modified without detection (integrity).
