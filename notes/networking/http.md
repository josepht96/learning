The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Webâ€™s application-layer protocol, is at the heart of the
Web. It is defined in [RFC 1945] and [RFC 2616]. HTTP is implemented in two programs: a client
program and a server program. The client program and server program, executing on different end
systems, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages. HTTP defines the structure of these
messages and how the client and server exchange the messages.
