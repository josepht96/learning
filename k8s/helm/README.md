## Versioning

Camunda Platform 8 **Helm chart** versions are only aligned with the minor version of [Camunda Platform 8](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform).
In other words, the `Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart` could have a patch version different from the `Camunda Platform 8`.

For example, the Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart could be on version `8.1.1`, but Camunda Platform 8 apps are on version `8.1.0`. Additionally, the Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart could be on version `8.1.1`, but Camunda Platform 8 apps are on version `8.1.2`.

We work to keep the Helm chart updated with the latest version of Camunda Platform 8, but currently this is not guaranteed. Note that the latest version of the Helm chart may not necessarily have the latest version of the Camunda Platform 8 apps. This should not be an issue unless you rely on a specific Camunda Platform 8 patch version. In that case, you can set the desired version via a custom values file.

## Requirements

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= 3.9.x
* Kubernetes >= 1.20+
* Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with default settings.
  All of these settings are configurable.
  * Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
  * 2GB of RAM for the JVM heap

## Dependencies

Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart is an umbrella chart for different components. Some are internal (sub-charts),
and some are external (third-party). The dependency management is fully automated and managed by Helm itself;
however, it's good to understand the dependency structure. This third-party dependency is reflected in the Helm chart
as follows:

```
camunda-platform
  |_ elasticsearch
  |_ identity
    |_ keycloak
      |_ postgresql
  |_ optimize
  |_ operate
  |_ tasklist
  |_ web-modeler
    |_ postgresql
  |_ zeebe
```

For example, Camunda Identity utilizes Keycloak and allows you to manage users, roles, and permissions
for Camunda Platform 8 components.

- Keycloak is a dependency for Camunda Identity, and PostgreSQL is a dependency for Keycloak.
- PostgreSQL is an optional dependency for Web Modeler.
- Elasticsearch is a dependency for the Camunda Platform chart, which is used in Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Optimize.

The values for the dependencies Keycloak and PostgreSQL can be set in the same hierarchy:

```yaml
identity:
  [identity values]
  keycloak:
    [keycloak values]
    postgresql:
      [postgresql values]
web-modeler:
  [web-modeler values]
  postgresql:
    [postgresql values]
```

## Installation

The first command adds the official Camunda Platform Helm charts repo, and the second installs the Camunda Platform
chart to your current Kubernetes context.

```shell
  helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
  helm install camunda-platform camunda/camunda-platform
```

### Local Kubernetes

We recommend using Helm on KIND for local environments, as the Helm configurations are battle-tested
and much closer to production systems.

For more details, follow the Camunda Platform 8
[local Kubernetes cluster guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/guides/local-kubernetes-cluster/).

### OpenShift

Check out [OpenShift Support](openshift/README.md) to get started with deploying the charts on Red Hat OpenShift. 

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```sh
helm uninstall YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

> **Note**
>
> Notice that all the Services and Pods will be deleted, but not the PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
> which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and Elasticsearch.

To free up the storage, you need to delete all the PVCs manually.

First, view the PVCs:

```sh
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
kubectl get pvc -l release=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:

```sh
kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
kubectl delete pvc -l release=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

Or you can delete the related Kubernetes namespace, which contains all PVCs.

## Configuration

The following sections contain the configuration values for the chart and each sub-chart. All of them can be overwritten
via a separate `values.yaml` file.

Check out the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) file, which contains the same content and documentation.

> **Note**
> For more details about deploying Camunda Platform 8 on Kubernetes, please visit the
> [Helm/Kubernetes installation instructions docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/overview/).

### Web Modeler (Beta)

> :warning: Web Modeler Self-Managed is currently offered as a [beta release](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/reference/early-access#beta) with limited availability for enterprise customers only. It is not recommended for production use, and there is no maintenance service guaranteed. Special [terms & conditions](https://camunda.com/legal/terms/camunda-platform/camunda-platform-8-self-managed/) apply. However, we encourage you to provide feedback via your designated support channel or the [Camunda Forum](https://forum.camunda.io/).

#### Docker registry
The Docker images for Web Modeler Beta are available in a private registry.
Enterprise customers either already have credentials to this registry, or they can request access to this registry through their CSM contact at Camunda.
To enable Kubernetes to pull the images from Camunda's registry, you'll need to:
- [create an image pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod) using the provided credentials
- configure the Web Modeler pods to use the secret:
  ```yaml
  web-modeler:
    image:
      pullSecrets:
        - name: <MY_SECRET_NAME>
   ```

#### Database
Web Modeler requires a PostgreSQL database to store the data.
You can either:
- deploy a PostgreSQL instance as part of the Helm release by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `true` (which will enable the `postgresql` chart dependency); this is the default setting
- configure a connection to an (existing) external database by setting `postgresql.enabled` to `false` and providing the values under `restapi.externalDatabase`

#### SMTP server
Web Modeler requires an SMTP server to send (notification) emails to users.
The SMTP connection can be configured with the values under `restapi.mail`.

#### Ingress
Running Web Modeler on a context path (like https://example.com/modeler) is not yet supported.
That is why the [global](#global) Ingress resource does not contain a rule for Web Modeler.
You can configure a separate Ingress resource for Web Modeler though using the values under `ingress` below.

### Elasticsearch

Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart has a dependency on the [Elasticsearch Helm Chart](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/README.md). All variables related to Elasticsearch can be found in [elastic/helm-charts/values.yaml](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/main/elasticsearch/values.yaml) and can be set under `elasticsearch`.

| Section | Parameter | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|-|
| `elasticsearch`| `enabled` | If true, enables Elasticsearch deployment as part of the Camunda Platform Helm chart | `true` |

**Example:**

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
  imageTag: <YOUR VERSION HERE>
```

### Keycloak

When Camunda Platform 8 Identity component is enabled by default, and it depends on
[Bitnami Keycloak chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/keycloak).
Since Keycloak is a dependency for Identity, all variables related to Keycloak can be found in
[bitnami/keycloak/values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/main/bitnami/keycloak/values.yaml)
and can be set under `identity.keycloak`.

| Section | Parameter | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|-|
| `identity.keycloak`| `enabled` | If true, enables Keycloak chart deployment as part of the Camunda Platform Helm chart | `true` |

**Example:**

```yaml
identity:
  keycloak:
    enabled: true
```

#### Keycloak Theme

Camunda provides a custom theme for the login page used in all apps. The theme is copied from the Identity image.

The theme is added to Keycloak by default, however, since Helm v3 (latest checked 3.10.x) doesn't merge lists
with custom values files, then you will need to add this to your own values file if you override any of
`extraVolumes`, `initContainers`, or `extraVolumeMounts`.

```yaml
identity:
  keycloak:
    extraVolumes:
    - name: camunda-theme
      emptyDir:
        sizeLimit: 10Mi
    initContainers:
    - name: copy-camunda-theme
      image: >-
        {{- $identityImageParams := (dict "base" .Values.global "overlay" .Values.global.identity) -}}
        {{- include "camundaPlatform.imageByParams" $identityImageParams }}
      imagePullPolicy: "{{ .Values.global.image.pullPolicy }}"
      command: ["sh", "-c", "cp -a /app/keycloak-theme/* /mnt"]
      volumeMounts:
      - name: camunda-theme
        mountPath: /mnt
    extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: camunda-theme
      mountPath: /opt/bitnami/keycloak/themes/identity
```

### Adding dynamic exporters to Zeebe Brokers

This chart supports the addition of Zeebe Exporters by using `initContainer` as shown in the following example:

```
extraInitContainers:
  - name: init-exporters-hazelcast
    image: busybox:1.35
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
    args: ['wget --no-check-certificate https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zeebe/hazelcast/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter/0.8.0-alpha1/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter-0.8.0-alpha1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -O /exporters/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter.jar; ls -al /exporters']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: exporters
      mountPath: /exporters/
  - name: init-exporters-kafka
    image: busybox:1.35
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
    args: ['wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kafka-exporter/releases/download/1.1.0/zeebe-kafka-exporter-1.1.0-uber.jar -O /exporters/zeebe-kafka-exporter.jar; ls -al /exporters']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: exporters
      mountPath: /exporters/
env:
  - name: ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_HAZELCAST_JARPATH
    value: /exporters/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter.jar
  - name: ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_HAZELCAST_CLASSNAME
    value: io.zeebe.hazelcast.exporter.HazelcastExporter
  - name: ZEEBE_HAZELCAST_REMOTE_ADDRESS
    value: "{{ .Release.Name }}-hazelcast"
```

This example is downloading the exporters' Jar from a URL and adding the Jars to the `exporters` directory,
which will be scanned for jars and added to the Zeebe broker classpath. Then with `environment variables`,
you can configure the exporter parameters.

## Development

For development purposes, you might want to deploy and test the charts without creating a new helm chart release.
To do this you can run the following:

```sh
 helm install YOUR_RELEASE_NAME --atomic --debug ./charts/camunda-platform
```

 * `--atomic if set, the installation process deletes the installation on failure. The --wait flag will be set automatically if --atomic is used`

 * `--debug enable verbose output`

To generate the resources/manifests without really installing them, you can use: 

 * `--dry-run simulate an install`

If you see errors like:

```sh
Error: found in Chart.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: elasticsearch
```

Then you need to download the dependencies first.

Run the following to add resolve the dependencies:

```sh
make helm.repos-add
```

After this, you can run: `make helm.dependency-update`, which will update and download the dependencies for all charts.

The execution should look like this:
```
$ make helm.dependency-update
helm dependency update charts/camunda-platform
