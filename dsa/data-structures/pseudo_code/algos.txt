[5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]
First num is sorted, second num is called key (at first)
Insertion sort:
Swap the key against the values before it. At each point if the key
is less than the value adjacant to it, swap them
So a key might be swapped many times to get to proper spot
[5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3] > [2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 3] > [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]
> [2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 3] > [2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 3] etc... 
Each step is O(n)
